# Running certain Java files

First thing you want to do is make sure you have installed
a version of Java Developer Kit (JDK)

Here is a link in case: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
Make sure everything is matched for your system

The next thing you want to do is make sure there are no errors

If there are errors when you use the commands to follow the 
*terminal* / *command line (cmd)* will inform you and you 
need to make the changes

But first step, find and remember where you file(s) / 
folder(s) are located

You need to memorize this in order to *cd* to this location


## If you made changes to an original Java file

If you made changes to an original Java file, 
you will need to update the .class version (executable form)

To do this you need to find your file(s)

First type in *javac*

Followed by the name of your Java file 
(Don't forget to include the .java ending)

Now press enter and you should see that the .class file has changed

From here you can run the file by in the terminal / cmd typing


## Running the executable form

To run the Java file, you need to open your terminal / cmd

Navigate over to the file(s) you want to run

Begin by typing *java* 
follow this with the file name 
(this time excluding the .java or .class parts)

Hit *enter*

Now the terminal / cmd will act as a console and return anything 
you wanted it to

Repeat this for anything you want to run and test


## If you want to force quit the running code

If the process takes a while you can always force quit by doing

*Ctrl* + *C*

This will force quit

After it has quit, you can return to your regular ways
