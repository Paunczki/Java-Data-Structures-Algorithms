9.  How many unique movies are there?
        -
10. How many unique cast members are there? You can assume that two people with identical
    names are the same people â€“ which we will agree as a bit of oversimplification.

11. How many edges are there?

12. Given a cast member, print the list of movies in which the cast member is featured in.

13. Write a method public void coCast (int minMovies) that when provided with a threshold minimum
    number of movies, lists all pairs of cast members that are featured together in at least minMovies
    along with the titles of such movies. For instance, coCast(5) will produce a list of pairs of cast
    members which are featured together in at least 5 movies.

14. In particular, run the method for minMovies =13 and produce the listing. It should give you nine
    pairs of cast members. Your method should not take more than 2 to 3 minutes to run. You must
    meet the runtime performance.

15. Also find the pair of cast members who have featured in the most number of movies together.
    Yes, there is only one and produce the movie title along with the names of the two cast members.

Of course, if you solved question 15 above, you got this one as well.
