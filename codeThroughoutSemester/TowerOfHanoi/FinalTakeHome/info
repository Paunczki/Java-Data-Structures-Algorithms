        What I need to find:
            1.  Given a user id, output the total number of times the user has voted to
                support or be neutral or oppose the candidate considered for promotion
                for all people the user has voted for collectively in all the elections.
            2.  Given a user id considered for promotion, output the user id and
                screen name of the nominator. For multiple nominations, you will
                output all nominators. If the user is not nominated ever, output
                an appropriate message.
            3.  Given user screen name, output the total number of votes the user got
                in support, neutral and in opposition and the result, if the user was
                considered was promotion. Otherwise, (the user was never
                considered for promotion), output an appropriate message.
            4.  Print all pairs of user screen names A and B, such that A has voted
                negatively for B and B has voted negatively for A in any election, if
                there is any such pair. Also, print the total number of such pairs of
                Wiki users/administrators.
