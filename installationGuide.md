## Installation for Mac or Linux

To install the directory you first need to open your terminal

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mac shortcut is press

*command* + *space*

Then type in *terminal* and press enter

Linus short just press

*Ctrl* + *Alt* + *T*

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A black box should appear that looks like a hacker terminal in the movies.

From here you need to know where you want to install the files to

The best way would be to create a folder, lets say Documents, and name it 
Java Data Strucutres and Algorithms

Once you have that folder ready, make sure you remeber the path to it 
(if you are having trouble, right click and press *Get Info*)

Now in the terminal / *black box*, use the command cd *______*
where you replace the *______* to the folder/directory you want to enter

If you want to see the contents of this folder/directory simply type *ls* 
and then press enter

Use these two commands to get to the folder you want this to be downloaded into

Once there, type in *git clone https://github.com/Paunczki/Java-Data-Structures-Algorithms.git*

With this you now have all the necessary files
