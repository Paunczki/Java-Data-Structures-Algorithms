# Java-Data-Structures-Algorithms

Note: Completely meant as a rigourous way to practice methods
By no means should anyone look for answers in this repository
Purely meant as supplemental practice

Meant completely for people to learn Data Strucutres and Algorithms for Java
It is assumed you have minimum programming experience
    - Compentency with creating and using varibales
    - if statements
    - that Java reads from top to bottom

These are notes from my COMP 271 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. Notes are made more presentable and understanding for any new user.

More information about the class can be found here
https://academics.cs.luc.edu/courses/comp271.html

This class was during the Spring 2019 Semester.

Original notes can be found at this link

Most important thing is if you are still confused about something,
Always refer to the documentation (at this time Java 8)
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/


## Important

There will be no guides/questions/answers given for anything contained in codeThroughoutSemester
This is because these were answers and work I did for a class where the 
information may be reused. 
Please do not copy these answers
I provided the materials I did as a way for people to look at my learning process. 

If you do need help with any of the parts if you are taking a similar class 
please reach out to me

You can always comment or create an issue and I can respond and hopefully help
