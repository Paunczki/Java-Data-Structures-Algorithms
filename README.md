# Java-Data-Structures-Algorithms
Meant completely for people to learn Data Strucutres and Algorithms for Java
It is assumed you have minimum programming experience
    - Compentency with creating and using varibales
    - if statements
    - that Java reads from top to bottom

These are notes from my COMP 271 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. Notes are made more presentable and understanding for any new user.
